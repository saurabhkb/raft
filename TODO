something is wrong with set commit index i think.
ive now made it so that commitIndex is initialized to the size of the loaded log, which ideally should help matters but this hasn't been tested.

when a new server becomes the leader, it needs to set the next index for eahc replica to something
should the append entries response include the commit index of the follower?
