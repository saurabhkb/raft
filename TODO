something is wrong with set commit index i think.
ive now made it so that commitIndex is initialized to the size of the loaded log, which ideally should help matters but this hasn't been tested.

when a new server becomes the leader, it needs to set the next index for eahc replica to something
should the append entries response include the commit index of the follower?

I am placing the last log index, last log term check before the term comparison since when a new follower comes up, even if he has a higher term number, since his log isn't as complete as ours, reject him and stay the leader (if you are one).

Had forgotten to update server's replica list once new configuration thing was set. Am doing it now.
Only thing is I need to figure out how the other servers find out about the new configuration (oh, through the size request message)
once a node gets that type of message, it needs to re-read the config-file and update its stuff accordingly
So I can't just send OLD_SIZE, I need to send NEW_SIZE too
